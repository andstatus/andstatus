    <release android:versionName="1.13.0" android:versionCode="71"
        versionDate="2013-03-29"
        versionTitle="User Timeline and Undo Reblog">
        <changes><change>The new "User" timeline added. Normally when you select "User" from the list
             of the timelines,  timeline of the current Account is shown.
             But when you select the "Messages by this User" menu item, a "User" timeline 
             for the selected User is been shown. 
             The timeline has messages from the cache which are shown immediately.
             The "Reload" options menu loads the timeline from the Internet. Automatic updates setting
             are taken into account for automatic update/download even without the manual "Reload" command.
             <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/18" >Issue #18</a>
            </change>
            <change>"Tweet/Blog" button can be accessed using keys. 
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/31" >Issue #31</a> </change>
            <change>In the combined timeline, actions on a selected message may be done
                on behalf of the selected account. I.e. not only on behalf of the account 
                whose timeline the message belongs to. This allows subscribing to the message
                in one accound and replying to it from another  
                (e.g. from account which is more relevant to the topic of current message).</change>
             <change>"Undo reblog" implemented. Each reblog (retweet) of the same message (tweet) is shown
                 as a separate item in the timeline now. This allows to undo reblog from specific account.
                 Information about original reblogger is stored also (in case we received the message alreagy as a reblog).</change>
        </changes>

        versionDate="2013-02-17"
        versionTitle="Migration to the Twitter API v.1.1.">
        <changes><change>Migration to the Twitter API v.1.1. 
            Twitter plans to start turning off an older API after March 1, 
            so this upgrade will be required very soon. See 
            <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/30">Issue #30</a></change>
        </changes>
        <change>Fixed: Mentions notifications missed in the Widget.</change>
    </release>
    <release android:versionName="1.11.4" android:versionCode="69"
        versionDate="2012-12-23"
        versionTitle="Combined timeline added">
        <changes>
            <change>Terminology, independent from twitter.com, is used. 
From now on we will avoid all proprietary terms for non-Twitter accounts. 
At the same time, in order to comply with Twitter "Developer Display Requirements", we will use alternative
(Twitter's proprietary) terms "tweet" and "retweet" in Twitter accounts and messages ("tweets").
See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/15">Issue #15</a>.
            </change>
            <change>Combined timeline added. 
In a case of many accounts it's becoming harder to check for new messages in each account.
A "Combined timeline" allows both read all new messages in one stream 
and search for all messages stored locally in all accounts, 
even if they were downloaded from different systems.
The "Home Combined" timeline shows not only messages from "Home" timelines of all accounts, 
but also messages, downloaded during other requests: e.g. previous messages of Conversations.
You can do all usual operations with messages in the Combined Timeline, including favoriting,
replying and reblogging.            </change>
            <change>Timeline type selection (Home/Favorites/Mentions/Direct Messages) moved 
            from a legacy "Options menu" to the top bar.
            </change>
            <change>French translation added. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kvnco">Kevin C.</a>
            </change>
            <change>Application Help screens rearranged and are accessible through 
                Preferences-"About AndStatus" menu. You may use swipe gestures to 
                turn help pages left and right.
                Change Log is also accessible locally via Preferences-"Change Log".</change>
            <change>In case you have accounts from more that one Microblogging system, 
                the "Select an account" button shows not only username but but name of the system also. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/24">Issue #24</a>.</change>

        versionTitle="Share via AndStatus">
        <changes><change>"Share via AndStatus" added for text data (including Web page sharing). 
            E.g. in a Web browser select "Share" menu item and you will see "AndStatus" in the list of destinations.
            Choose AndStatus, and the page title and its URL will be inserted into the new tweet.

        versionTitle="Multiple User accounts support">
        <changes>
            <change>Multiple User Accounts support added.
                User can easily switch timeline between accounts.</change>
            <change>Accounts are managed using Android Account Manager (in "Accounts and sync" device settings).
                This is why new permissions were added.</change>
            <change>Fix for "Use External Storage" option for Android v.4.0.
                This fix forced us to compile package against Android v.4.0 (API 15). 
                However AndStatus still works for Android v.2.2 and higher.</change>
            <change>Fixed Search and "Loading..." layouts for Android v.4.0.</change>
        </changes>
    </release>
    <release android:versionName="1.4.2" android:versionCode="55"
        versionDate="2012-03-20"
        versionTitle="&quot;Native&quot; Retweets, Advanced Data Model and moving to Android 2.2">
        <changes>
            <change>"Native" Retweet implemented. Tweets retweeted in AndStatus
             are shown as "Retweeted" in twitter.com also.</change>
            <change>Home timeline shows authors of Retweets, not users who retweeted them.</change>
            <change>Underlying Data model has been totally redesigned in order to be able to 
            accommodate upcoming enhancements:
            1. Multiple user Accounts.
            2. Multiple Instant messaging systems (twitter.com, identi.ca etc.).
            3. References between messages (tweets, dents, statuses…), Users and Accounts.
            Unfortunately advanced SQL queries used in the code are not supported by the 
            SQLite engine built-in Android prior v.2.2 (API 8).
            This means that this updated application works only on Android v.2.2 and above.
            </change>
            <change>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission was added to the Manifest. 
            Otherwhise "Use External Storage" doesn't work (after compilation for API 8. 
            It worked for API 3 though..).</change>
        </changes>
    </release>
    <release android:versionName="1.3.2" android:versionCode="52"
        versionDate="2012-02-25"
        versionTitle="External storage">
        <changes>
            <change>Added "Use External Storage" option. When a User changes
                this option, System moves database file to External storage
                and back when this option is set to use Internal storage.</change>
            <change>Deprecated "Statuses/friends_timeline" API changed to
                "statuses/home_timeline". "Friends" menu item replaced with
                "Home" to reflect this change.</change>

                <change>Added option to Share tweet.</change>
                <change>Improved interface of the "User credentials" group of Preferences to make it more clear for new users (Issue 61)</change>
                <change>Internal application changes that require recreating AndStatus Widget after upgrade to this version.</change>
                <change>Fixed: Sometimes twitter.com succeeds to create/delete favorite, 
                   but doesn't change 'favorited' flag in the returned tweet.
                   Sometimes it fails, but doesn't indicate error.
                   (This is twitter.com feature: asynchronous processes…)</change>
                <change>Fixed: Issue 45: Manually setting a username and authenticating with another does not work.</change>
                <change>Fixed: Issue 50: tells me credentials are for other user.</change>

    <changes>
        <change>
            Working offline or in bad connection conditions is
            implemented.
            Now User doesn't have to wait for the "Command execution
            on a Server" after updating his status (i.e. sending a tweet)
            and may continue reading and
            writing tweets, making them Favorite etc.
            while AndStatus stores all the
            commands in the queue and retries delivery
            upon every automatic update and also
            during any manual command (Reload or Status update).
            User is being notified about number of messages
            currently in the Output queue
            (If
            Notifications are being enabled).
            Queues of unsent commands persist in the phone's memory. 
            Even after shutdown for Android v.1.6 and up.</change>
        <change>Changes in the application permissions.
            Two (location)
            permissions were removed, one permission was added
            to help
            asynchronous message delivery (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).</change>

        <change>New Preference "Minimum logging level" added to allow changing 
            Logging level from within the application Preferences.</change>
        <change>Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndStatus's
            timelines open
            faster thanks to less requests and redrawing.</change>
