# AndStatus

AndStatus is an Open Source multiple accounts client for multiple Social networks, including

AndStatus can combine your feeds from all networks into one Timeline,

## Differentiating features of AndStatus:
* Many accounts in different Social networks. You may have several accounts in each, write/reply as any "You" and share between accounts and systems.
* You don't need to be online to read timelines and to post your updates: drafts and unsent posts are kept even after reboot. They will be sent when your device is Online.
* Convenient tree-like "Conversation view".
* "Global search" allowing you to search public messages in all networks with one query.
* Lists of Friends and Followers, presented as User Lists and as Timelines (with the latest message of each user)
* Tweets/messages/avatars/attached images are being synced in a background, when your device has a good connection. By default, attachments are downloaded via WiFi only.
* Cached data may be stored for years or for several days only - it's your choice.
* Backup and restore accounts and messages between your devices. Own your data!
* Free and without ads, community supported.
