          v.15.0 (122)
          Discovery of open GNU Social instances</h2><ol><li>Implemented discovery of open GNU Social instances (servers)
                using the new "get_open_instances"
                <a href="http://gstools.org/api/doc/">gstools.org API</a>. 
                From now on there is no need to have all open instances 
                preconfigured in AndStatus:
                a User may select new "Microblogging system" 
                from a live list, downloaded via an online service. 
                We hope that this feature will stimulate GNU social instance owners to
                register in this discovery service.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/84">#84</a>
            </li><li>"SSL Mode" setting moved to Microblogging system, 
                allowing to have specific SSL mode per Microblogging system.
            </li><li>Added two options to Microblogging system: "Include in Global Search
				while in Combined Timeline" and 
				"Include in Reload while in Combined Public timeline".
            </li><li>Added "Swipe to Refresh" feature for a Timeline view. 
                The swipe duplicates "Reload" menu item.</li><li>Syncing indicator on a Timeline moved to the bottom and 
                it doesn't cause timeline tremors anymore.</li><li>Fixed ANR (application freeze/or crash) when requesting download of
				Avatars and Attachments during a Timeline drawing.
            </li><li>Added Japanese (<a href="https://crowdin.com/profile/naofum">naofum</a>) 
                and Arabic (<a href="https://quitter.no/dragnucs">dragnucs</a>) translations. 
                Thank you for contributions!</li></ol><h2>2014-02-03 
          v.14.4 (121)
          Stalled connections are killed</h2><ol><li>Fixed: Sometimes a command/connection doesn't end after
                a predefined timeout (10 minutes without a progress). 
                In this case a utility "Heartbeat"
                process kills the command execution.<br>
                This fix should help Users, who encountered syncing stop, 
                and also people complaining about too high
                power consumption (due to a too long background work...)
            </li><li>Implemented: On a first launch the system tries to store data on SD
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/216">#216</a>
            </li><li>Fixed: Unable to send a message with an asterisk (*) on Twitter
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/219">#219</a>
            </li><li>Added another message context menu item: "Open Conversation",
                which effectively duplicates a single click on a message, 
                but looks like may help newbies to find, where Conversation view is.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/209">#209</a>
            </li><li>Added "Remove account" action to the Account settings view
                as an alternative way to delete AndStatus accounts.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/223">#223</a>
            </li><li>UX improvement: Added "Commands in the Queue" item to Action bars of 
                a Timeline and a Conversation views.

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/179">#179</a></li><li>UX improvement: When after upgrade Change log is shown, 
                the button below it is "Skip" now, 
                not "Get started" as during the first launch

                For them another debugging option added: "Insecure SSL".<br> 
                Now there are three values of the "SSL mode and security":<br> 
                1. Secure SSL (default)<br>
                2. Insecure SSL<br>

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/204">#204</a></li><li>"Log network level messages" option added allowing deeper debugging.
	            If "Log everything to file" is also enabled, separate .json files are

                [pump.io] Don't make a Reply ("Comment") public. Now a Reply fully relies

          v.13.2 (115)
          Debugging option allowing misconfigured SSL</h2><ol><li>Added an option to "Allow misconfigured SSL" connections 
                (inside "Logging and Debugging") to support those users, who cannot afford
                changing their providers or install a proper certificate to their site but still need
                SSL connection. Setting this option should be considered only as as a temporary
                measure. TLS and SNI protocols are not supported while this option is turned on.

          Don't sync 'Following' timeline automatically</h2><ol><li>The "Following" timeline excluded from the list 
                of automatically synced timelines as this is actually a waste of time and traffic:
                the list of users "I'm following" changes far less often than
                new posts appear.  
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/128">Issue #128</a>.<br>

                </li><li>Localizable strings reorganized and simplified in order to allow 
                application translation using simple Web tools. AndStatus Crowdsourcing and

          v.12.0 (111)
          Don't merge Users with the same nicknames [StatusNet]</h2><ol><li>Fixed undesirable merge of Users with the same nicknames [StatusNet]. This is 
                actual for the cases, <br>
                1) When messages by users with the same nickname exist in one instance 
                (e.g. when the users' profiles are at different servers).<br>
                2) When a User changes their nickname.<br>
                This feature is implemented by comparing not Nicknames, as before, but WebFinger IDs
                of users.

                suitable in a case you have in your timeline the same messages, received
                from different Microblogging systems.</li><li>Fixed AndStatus launcher icon size based on info from

                You may also start writing a post as usual and attach an image later 
                (this way you can attach an image to Reply).

                in Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Appearance-&gt;"Display attached images".
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/93">Issue #93</a>.<br>
                An accompanying option added: Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;"Download 
                attachments over Wi-Fi only" ("on" by default).</li><li>Added an option to set Default Account (account, which timeline is
                opened on application launch).</li><li>Added support for instances of Microblogging systems, which are located in a folder of the host 
                (i.e. not in the root of the host). To configure such a system in AndStatus 
                type full address (i.e. URL, including http...)  of the system into the "Host" field 
                of the Microblogging system's editor.

                are automatically translated to HTML line breaks,

          v.9.0 (103)
          Backup/Restore and Syncing indicator</h2><ol><li>Application data backup and restore implemented. This feature may be used in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual backup at any time to SD card (Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Backup application
                         data) and manual restore after reinstall: from the first screen and from 
                         Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Restore application data.</li>
                    <li>Automatic backup and restore by Android system. This may work for some devices, 
                        but currently is useless for the most users due to Android system internal limitations 
                        (see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/pull/49">this discussion</a>).</li>
                </ul>
                Preferences, messages and accounts with their credentials are backed up. Avatars are not. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/86">Issue #86</a>.</li><li>"Sync while using application" option added (turned on by default, as it was earlier). 
                When this option is turned off (in Settings-&gt;Syncing), 
                there is no background sync while browsing timeline and conversations 
                in order to preserve smoothness of scrolling. Manually initiated updates 
                occur in background though.</li><li>AndStatus syncing indicator is added to the Timeline screen. 
                To turn this feature off, 
                go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Syncing indicator on timeline.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/63">Issue #63</a>.</li><li>Added an option to change Connection timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds. 
                (go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Connection timeout) 
                Increasing this value may improve connections with slow servers. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/83">Issue #83</a>.</li><li>Overflow button added to Action bars of Activities, which have Options menues.</li><li>BOOT_COMPLETED permission added in order to update a Widget after boot.</li><li>Due to incompatibility with changed Twitter site behavior, addition of new Twitter
                accounts is allowed only for Android v.4.2. and higher. You may workaround this using 
                backup/restore. See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/92">Issue #92</a></li></ol><h2>2014-04-20

          Public Timeline and Global Search</h2><ol><li>"Public" Timeline added to the list of available timelines. 
                The latest messages from the Public Timeline may be fetched on demand 
                for StatusNet-type microblogging systems via "Reload" context menu item.                  
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/73">Issue #73</a>.
                Public timeline is per a Microblogging system, not per an Account.</li><li>Context menu on Public Timeline has a "Global search" item,
                allowing searching messages online for Twitter and StatusNet-type systems 
                (requires Internet connection). <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/503">Pump.io 
                doesn't have a global search service yet</a>.<br> 
                Thus the Public timeline shows both messages, "Reloaded" from Public Timeline directly,
                and messages, retrieved via: "Global Search", "Messages by this User" and Messages, 
                automatically retrieved for Conversation trees.</li><li>Options menu in Account activity allows to open Settings 
                e.g. to add new Microblogging system.</li><li>Fixed: Android fast scroll thumb disappears after switching Timeline type or "combined" mode.</li><li>In the presence of background operations the Timeline is now operating smoothly
                and doesn't freeze. Potentially long operations moved to the background thread.                  
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/33">Issue #33</a></li><li>Spanish translation added, thanks to <a href="https://identi.ca/susobaco">Suso Comesaña</a></li><li>Fixed "Preserve screen position after content update". As a Timeline is being
                updated in the background, new messages don't cause unexpected list scrolling any more.

          v.7.1 (95)
          Design for the Novice</h2><ol><li>Getting started with AndStatus is simplified, including creation of the first user account. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/75">Issue #75</a></li><li>Action bar added to the "Settings" and "Account" screens (for Android 4.x+) in 
                order to show a "Way back" to a User. These screens have new, more common names.</li><li>"Manage accounts" link in AndStatus Settings now leads directly to the list of accounts
                avoiding long Android's "System Settings" list. 
                This simplifies working with existing accounts.
                In order to add the second and further accounts an additional button created. 
                Note: In order to delete an account a User still has to go 
                to the native Android interface: System Settings-&gt;Accounts.</li><li>A User Guide updated (English and Russian translations). 
                The User Guide is available by tapping the "Learn more" button 
                on the "About AndStatus" screen.</li></ol><h2>2014-01-26

          Multiple instances of Microblogging systems</h2><ol><li>"Type of Microblogging system" ("twitter" / "pump.io" / "status.net" ) separated
                from the "Microblogging System" of one of these types. 
                Names of these systems are currently: "Twitter" , "pump.io" , and lots of systems 
                of the status.net type with their own Names and Hosts, e.g. "Quitter" at the "quitter.se" 
                host, "Friendica" at some of its hosts ("hubs") etc.
                Now User may create any number of "Microblogging systems" of the three existing types. 
                In practice, this is mostly useful for the "status.net" sites, including
                <a href="https://quitter.se/">Quitter</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/55">Friendica</a>.
                See ""Preferences"-"Manage Microblogging Systems" menu item.

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/58">Issue #58</a></li><li>Added "Allow HTML content" option for each Microblogging system, 
                which allows to see formatted message content.
                Pump.io and StatusNet/Friendica support HTML formatting in messages. 
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/60">Issue #60</a>.</li><li>Host of each Microblogging system may be configured. This may allow, for example, 
                connection to the Twitter sites through proxy server. On the other hand,
                this may be not exactly what <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/43">Issue 
                #43 "Implement Connection via proxy"</a> mean.</li><li>Fixed sending messages offline.</li><li>Fixed too many requests to the server in some cases.</li></ol><h2>2013-12-09 
          v.5.1 (89)
          Option to show avatars added</h2><ol><li>Avatars are displayed by default for new installations, 
                but are turned off for upgrades to preserve familiar environment of existing users.
                In order to turn avatars on please go to Preferences-Appearance and set 
                the "Display Avatars" checkbox. 
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/39">Issue #39</a>.</li><li>Fixed "Added accounts are lost when App is moved to SD Card"
                by adding to the AndroidManifest explicit declaration that AndStatus is allowed
                to be installed on internal storage only
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/21">Issue #21</a>.
                In short: Losing application accounts after moving the app to SD card
                is expected Android system behavior.
                In order to address this limitation, AndStatus offers Storage - "Use External Storage"
                option for its data.

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/45">Issue #45</a>.</li><li>Convenience: If "User" is current timeline, and we see messages by one of my accounts, 
                changing current account doesn't change timeline type, as it was before.</li><li>Fixes for Android v.2.x: Improved Conversation view (colored lines
                added!), message text color fixed.</li><li>Fixed "Date parse error causes crash of the application"

                but also latest replies, if they were already downloaded. 
                Plus other branches of the same tree. Different branched are shown with indentation.

          Answering in Conversation view added</h2><ol><li>When clicking on a message in a Timeline, 
                you see the message or the whole thread. You can act on
                messages of this thread (reply, make favorite etc.) just like in the Timeline view
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/40">Issue #40</a>.
			</li><li>Theme support extended. Now AndStatus allows selecting Device Default, 
                Light and Dark themes, using Holo themes for compatible devices. 
                Light Theme is fixed for Android v.3+ 
                (because the Holo.Light theme is used, not a legacy theme as for the older devices).

          v.2.1 (84)
          StatusNet support added</h2><ol><li>Added support of the "<a href="http://status.net/">StatusNet</a>"-like sites: "Even though identi.ca 
            has changed to pump.io there are many StatusNet servers outside 
            (and servers that are compatible with the StatusNet API)", 
            see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/37">Issue #37</a>.
            Actually, previously existed support for the Twitter-compatible StatusNet API 
            was re-enabled with two additions: 1. The actual name of the StatusNet server
            is now customizable (it may be e.g. <a href="https://quitter.se/andstatus">quitter.se</a> 
            or any compatible server). You may have several StatusNet accounts in AndStatus application, 
            but all of them should be on the same server. 2. Maximum number of characters
            in the message is being read from the server's configuration.</li></ol><h2>2013-10-08

            AndStatus adds one more item to the message context menu, allowing you "to act as..." another 
            account on the same message. This feature may be very convenient when e.g. one of the users 
            you are following as an "account1", posts a note, which is more appropriate for discussion 
            (replying or reblogging) as your another identity: "account2". This allows your accounts 
            to be more focused (on one language, one topic etc.) and to avoid following the same user 
            by more than one of your accounts.</li><li>"Following" timeline always shows names of the users being followed by our account(s), 
                even for reblogged messages.</li><li>Accounts in the "Select an Account" list are sorted alphabetically. 
                Accounts, which are not successfully authenticated, are shown in parentheses.

            authors of StatusNet and of identi.ca service as it was before July 2013.
            Pump.io is also a new engine for the <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> site, 
            which now is a part of the federated, distributed pump.io social network.
            AndStatus sees the whole network as one Microblogging system supporting user accounts
            from all its nodes not limiting to the identi.ca site only.
            After installation of this app version old identi.ca accounts and data 
            are automatically converted to be used with the new pump.io system. 
            <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/34">Issue #34</a>.
             </li><li>Internal app structure redone in order to accommodate different

          Timeline synchronization is managed by Android core</h2><ol><li>Timeline synchronization is greatly improved because now Android itself does 
            this smartly for us.
            A user can <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/1663705?hl=en">Configure 
            account sync options</a> individually for each account

            <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/29">Issue #29</a>.
            As a result of this change, "Automatic updates" setting was removed from preferences.
            Please enable Sync in Settings for your old accounts after installing this version of the application!
             </li><li>New preference added: Notification of "Commands in the queue" to be sent. Off by default.

                 </li><li>Creation of new identi.ca accounts disabled, sync for identi.ca accounts doesn't work. 
                 This is because the identi.ca service changed its underlying API from Twitter-compatible (StatusNet)

             The timeline has messages from the cache which are shown immediately.
             The "Reload" options menu loads the timeline from the Internet. If you have "Automatic updates"

From now on we will avoid all proprietary terms for non-Twitter accounts. 
At the same time, in order to comply with Twitter "Developer Display Requirements", we will use alternative
(Twitter's proprietary) terms "tweet" and "retweet" in Twitter accounts and messages ("tweets").
See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/15">Issue #15</a>.
            </li><li>Combined timeline added. 
In a case of many accounts it's becoming harder to check for new messages in each account.
A "Combined timeline" allows both read all new messages in one stream 
and search for all messages stored locally in all accounts, 
even if they were downloaded from different systems.
The "Home Combined" timeline shows not only messages from "Home" timelines of all accounts, 
but also messages, downloaded during other requests: e.g. previous messages of Conversations.
You can do all usual operations with messages in the Combined Timeline, including favoriting,
replying and reblogging.

            E.g. in a Web browser select "Share" menu item and you will see "AndStatus" in the list of destinations.
            Choose AndStatus, and the page title and its URL will be inserted into the new tweet.
            </li></ol><h2>2012-08-06 
          v.1.9.1 (61)
          Conversation view</h2><ol><li>Single message (Tweet) view expanded to show full conversation
                 in case the Tweet is a reply to other Tweet.
                 Previous Tweets are being retrieved asynchronously.</li><li>Fixed replies for identi.ca</li></ol><h2>2012-08-01 
          v.1.8.0 (59)
          identi.ca support added</h2><ol><li>Identi.ca support added. Currently only basic authentication works (i.e. no OAuth for identi.ca yet).</li></ol><h2>2012-07-28 
          v.1.7.0 (58)
          Manage Accounts code adapted for Jelly Bean</h2><ol><li>Manage Accounts code adapted for Jelly Bean. The app works ok on Android v.2.2 - 4.1 now.</li></ol><h2>2012-07-07 
          v.1.6.0 (57)
          Send Direct Message added</h2><ol><li>Send Direct Message added.</li><li>Message is counted as new only if it didn't exist in the database yet.</li><li>While editing tweet, system calculates characters left taking shortened URL's length into account!</li><li>Too long wake lock fixed.</li></ol><h2>2012-06-09 
          v.1.5.0 (56)
          Multiple User accounts support</h2><ol><li>Multiple User Accounts support added.
                User can easily switch timeline between accounts.</li><li>Accounts are managed using Android Account Manager (in "Accounts and sync" device settings).
                This is why new permissions were added.</li><li>Fix for "Use External Storage" option for Android v.4.0.
                This fix forced us to compile package against Android v.4.0 (API 15). 
                However AndStatus still works for Android v.2.2 and higher.</li><li>Fixed Search and "Loading..." layouts for Android v.4.0.</li></ol><h2>2012-03-20 
          v.1.4.2 (55)
          "Native" Retweets, Advanced Data Model and moving to Android 2.2</h2><ol><li>"Native" Retweet implemented. Tweets retweeted in AndStatus
             are shown as "Retweeted" in twitter.com also.</li><li>Home timeline shows authors of Retweets, not users who retweeted them.</li><li>Underlying Data model has been totally redesigned in order to be able to 
            accommodate upcoming enhancements:
            1. Multiple user Accounts.
            2. Multiple Instant messaging systems (twitter.com, identi.ca etc.).
            3. References between messages (tweets, dents, statuses), Users and Accounts.
            Unfortunately advanced SQL queries used in the code are not supported by the 
            SQLite engine built-in Android prior v.2.2 (API 8).
            This means that this updated application works only on Android v.2.2 and above.
            </li><li>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission was added to the Manifest. 
            Otherwhise "Use External Storage" doesn't work (after compilation for API 8. 
            It worked for API 3 though..).</li></ol><h2>2012-02-25 
          v.1.3.2 (52)
          External storage</h2><ol><li>Added "Use External Storage" option. When a User changes
                this option, System moves database file to External storage
                and back when this option is set to use Internal storage.</li><li>Deprecated "Statuses/friends_timeline" API changed to
                "statuses/home_timeline". "Friends" menu item replaced with
                "Home" to reflect this change.</li></ol><h2>2011-10-26 
          v.1.2.2 (46)
          </h2><ol><li>Implemented "Move Enter your tweet here field to it's own screen" request (Issue 60)</li><li>Added option to Share tweet.</li><li>Improved interface of the "User credentials" group of Preferences to make it more clear for new users (Issue 61)</li><li>Internal application changes that require recreating AndStatus Widget after upgrade to this version.</li><li>Fixed: Sometimes twitter.com succeeds to create/delete favorite, 
                   but doesn't change 'favorited' flag in the returned tweet.
                   Sometimes it fails, but doesn't indicate error.
                   (This is twitter.com feature: asynchronous processes)</li><li>Fixed: Issue 45: Manually setting a username and authenticating with another does not work.</li><li>Fixed: Issue 50: tells me credentials are for other user.</li><li>Fixed: Errors in the Service when it's stopped during command execution.</li></ol><h2>2011-09-23 
          v.1.1.7 (43)
          </h2><ol><li>
            Working offline or in bad connection conditions is
            implemented.
            Now User doesn't have to wait for the "Command execution
            on a Server" after updating his status (i.e. sending a tweet)
            and may continue reading and
            writing tweets, making them Favorite etc.
            while AndStatus stores all the
            commands in the queue and retries delivery
            upon every automatic update and also
            during any manual command (Reload or Status update).
            User is being notified about number of messages
            currently in the Output queue
            (If
            Notifications are being enabled).
            Queues of unsent commands persist in the phone's memory. 
            Even after shutdown for Android v.1.6 and up.</li><li>Changes in the application permissions.
            Two (location)
            permissions were removed, one permission was added
            to help
            asynchronous message delivery (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).</li><li>Improved user experience during initial configuration till first tweets loading</li><li>"Verify" preference moved to the top of the "User
            Credentials"
            preference's
            section, because User can really start from tapping it
            (typing Username is not required for OAuth)!</li><li>Widget shows last time when data was successfully
            downloaded from the server, not when there was last attempt to do
            this (maybe it failed)</li><li>New Preference "Minimum logging level" added to allow changing 
            Logging level from within the application Preferences.</li><li>Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndStatus's
            timelines open
            faster thanks to less requests and redrawing.</li><li>Fixed issue 12 "Themes do not apply until app is restarted"</li><li>Fixed bug preventing timeline position restore.</li><li>Fixed errors loading data from the Internet due to
            parallel
            OAuth requests. (e.g. during initial loading of the User's timeline).</li><li>Fixed blank screen in Preferences activity during
            authentication
            after redirect from Twitter web site.</li><li>Fixed "black on black" tweet text on "Single tweet"
            window on
            Android v.2.3.3</li></ol><h2>2011-02-19 
          v.1.0.5 (35)
          </h2><ol><li>"Favorites" list added.</li><li>Favorites are protected from automatic deletion (unlike other old tweets)</li><li>Click on Widget opens the timeline, that has something new, in this order: 
                messages, mentions, tweets</li><li>Maximum History time (to store tweets) is 1 year now</li><li>OAuth is On By Default.</li><li>Mentions are not "quick Search" any
        more, they are just another type of "Timeline". So we may search in
        Mentions also.</li><li>"Automatic updates" setting is not being turned off
        by the System. (in beta1:)</li><li>Fixed issue: Old records are not being deleted.</li></ol>
