        versionTitle="Debugging option allowing misconfigured SSL">
        <changes>
            <change>Added an option to &quot;Allow misconfigured SSL&quot; connections 
                (inside &quot;Logging and Debugging&quot;) to support those users, who cannot afford
                changing their providers or install a proper certificate to their site but still need
                SSL connection. Setting this option should be considered only as as a temporary
                measure. TLS and SNI protocols are not supported while this option is turned on.
                See <a href="https://status.vinilox.eu/conversation/3020524">this discussion</a>.
            </change>

        versionTitle="Migration to Android v.4.1 and the latest secure communication protocols">
        <changes>

                recently strengthened security at some servers.

        versionTitle="Don't sync 'Following' timeline automatically">
        <changes>
            <change>The &quot;Following&quot; timeline excluded from the list 
                of automatically synced timelines as this is actually a waste of time and traffic:
                the list of users &quot;I'm following&quot; changes far less often than
                new posts appear.  
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/128" >Issue #128</a>.<br />
                Currently these timelines are synced automatically: Home, Mentions and Direct.</change>
            <change>&quot;Commands in the Queue&quot; screen added 
                (inside &quot;Logging and debugging&quot; settings group)
                in order to help diagnoze syncing problems. This screens is opened, when you
                tap Notification on the messages in the Queue.
                </change>
            <change>Localizable strings reorganized and simplified in order to allow

        versionTitle="Don't merge Users with the same nicknames [StatusNet]">
        <changes>
            <change>Fixed undesirable merge of Users with the same nicknames [StatusNet]. This is 
                actual for the cases, <br/>
                1) When messages by users with the same nickname exist in one instance 
                (e.g. when the users' profiles are at different servers).<br/>
                2) When a User changes their nickname.<br/>
                This feature is implemented by comparing not Nicknames, as before, but WebFinger IDs
                of users. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/125" >Issue #125</a>.</change>
            <change>Added "How to show a User in a Timeline" option, allowing to choose, how you would like
                to see references to users in a Timeline. Available options are: 
                username, @username, WebFingerID, Real Name and Real Name @username</change>    
            <change>Added "Display Microblogging system in a Timeline" option, 
                suitable in a case you have in your timeline the same messages, received
                from different Microblogging systems.</change>    
            <change>Fixed AndStatus launcher icon size based on info from 
                <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12768128/android-launcher-icon-size">Android

        <changes>
            <change>Now you may share an image via AndStatus, add text and post it.
                You may also start writing a post as usual and attach an image later 
                (this way you can attach an image to Reply).
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/93" >Issue #93</a>.</change>
            <change>AndStatus icon redrawn.</change>

        versionTitle="Viewing attached images">
        <changes>
            <change>Added an option to view attached images for all supported systems. Turn this option off
                in Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Appearance-&gt;&quot;Display attached images&quot;.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/93" >Issue #93</a>.<br/>
                An accompanying option added: Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;&quot;Download 
                attachments over Wi-Fi only&quot; (&quot;on&quot; by default).</change>
            <change>Added an option to set Default Account (account, which timeline is
                opened on application launch).</change>
            <change>Added support for instances of Microblogging systems, which are located in a folder of the host 
                (i.e. not in the root of the host). To configure such a system in AndStatus 
                type full address (i.e. URL, including http...)  of the system into the "Host" field 
                of the Microblogging system's editor.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/116" >Issue #116</a> 
                with an example of connecting to SDF GNU Social site.</change>
            <change>Global search is available from any timeline. Switch to Public timeline
                is automatic.</change>
            <change>Fixed: User timeline worked correctly in Combined mode only.</change>    
            <change>Fixed: Cannot load next timeline page if previous position was stored
                when too few rows existed.</change>

        versionTitle="Mark replies to myself in Timeline. Twitter for old devices back again">
        <changes>
            <change>Added &quot;Mark replies to myself in Timeline&quot; option allowing
                to easily see posts, which are most relevant for a User.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/108" >Issue #108</a>.</change>
            <change>Fixed incompatibility with changed Twitter site behavior. Addition of new Twitter
                accounts is allowed for all supported devices!
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/92" >Issue #92</a></change>
            <change>In posts to Pump.io &quot;new lines&quot; (inserted e.g. by pressing ENTER key) 
                are automatically translated to HTML line breaks,
                so resulted post has line breaks, as expected.</change>
            <change>Pressing ENTER key while editing post inserts newline at the current position, 
                not at the end as before.</change>
            <change>HTML-formatted messages are shared both as HTML and as a plain text 
                (according to Android docs).</change>

        versionTitle="Share message to another account and Open it on Internet">
        <changes>
            <change>&quot;Share&quot; message action improved to allow message sharing from one account
                to another, including sharing between different Microblogging systems. When you 
                &quot;Share&quot; a message from AndStatus to AndStatus 
                (and the same when sharing to AndStatus from any other application...),
                Account selector opens. Shared "Subject" and "Text" are not blindly concatenated, 
                as before: you will not have to delete duplicated text. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/112" >Issue #112</a>.</change>
            <change>&quot;Open on Internet&quot; message context menu
				item added. See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/97" >Issue #97</a>.</change>
            <change>Added &quot;ENTER key sends message&quot; option (&quot;on&quot; by default 
				to preserve existing behaviour). 
				Setting it to &quot;off&quot; allows inserting newline 
				in the message. In order to see these new lines in the messages,  
				&quot;Allow HTML content&quot; option should be set for this Microblogging System.</change>
            <change>Added &quot;Old messages first in Conversation view&quot; option allowing 
                to reverse the order of messages in the Conversation view.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/67" >Issue #67</a>.</change>
            <change>Added &quot;Sync after message was sent&quot; option.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/65" >Issue #65</a>.</change>
            <change>&quot;Blog&quot; term changed to &quot;Post&quot; in all Microblogging systems except Twitter.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/15" >Issue #15</a>.</change>
            <change>Action icons updated with unified Android icons; German translation updated, 
                thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vinzv" >@vinzv</a>. <br/>
                Default avatars also updated, different for Dark and Light themes.</change>

        versionTitle="Backup/Restore and Syncing indicator">
        <changes>
            <change>Application data backup and restore implemented. This feature may be used in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual backup at any time to SD card (Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Backup application
                         data) and manual restore after reinstall: from the first screen and from 
                         Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Restore application data.</li>
                    <li>Automatic backup and restore by Android system. This may work for some devices, 
                        but currently is useless for the most users due to Android system internal limitations 
                        (see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/pull/49" >this discussion</a>).</li>
                </ul>
                Preferences, messages and accounts with their credentials are backed up. Avatars are not. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/86" >Issue #86</a>.</change>
            <change>&quot;Sync while using application&quot; option added (turned on by default, as it was earlier). 
                When this option is turned off (in Settings-&gt;Syncing), 
                there is no background sync while browsing timeline and conversations 
                in order to preserve smoothness of scrolling. Manually initiated updates 
                occur in background though.</change>
            <change>AndStatus syncing indicator is added to the Timeline screen. 
                To turn this feature off, 
                go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Syncing indicator on timeline.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/63" >Issue #63</a>.</change>
            <change>Added an option to change Connection timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds. 
                (go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Connection timeout) 
                Increasing this value may improve connections with slow servers. 
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/83" >Issue #83</a>.</change>
            <change>Overflow button added to Action bars of Activities, which have Options menues.</change>    
            <change>BOOT_COMPLETED permission added in order to update a Widget after boot.</change>
            <change>Due to incompatibility with changed Twitter site behavior, addition of new Twitter
                accounts is allowed only for Android v.4.2. and higher. You may workaround this using 
                backup/restore. See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/92" >Issue #92</a></change>

        <changes>
            <change>"Public" Timeline added to the list of available timelines. 
                The latest messages from the Public Timeline may be fetched on demand 
                for StatusNet-type microblogging systems via "Reload" context menu item.                  
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/73" >Issue #73</a>.
                Public timeline is per a Microblogging system, not per an Account.</change>
            <change>Context menu on Public Timeline has a "Global search" item,
                allowing searching messages online for Twitter and StatusNet-type systems 
                (requires Internet connection). <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/503" >Pump.io 
                doesn't have a global search service yet</a>.<br/> 
                Thus the Public timeline shows both messages, "Reloaded" from Public Timeline directly,
                and messages, retrieved via: "Global Search", "Messages by this User" and Messages,

            <change>Action bar added to the "Settings" and "Account" screens (for Android 4.x+) in

                In order to add the second and further accounts an additional button created. 
                Note: In order to delete an account a User still has to go

        <changes>
            <change>"Type of Microblogging system" ("twitter" / "pump.io" / "status.net" ) separated
                from the "Microblogging System" of one of these types. 
                Names of these systems are currently: "Twitter" , "pump.io" , and lots of systems 
                of the status.net type with their own Names and Hosts, e.g. "Quitter" at the "quitter.se" 
                host, "Friendica" at some of its hosts ("hubs") etc.
                Now User may create any number of "Microblogging systems" of the three existing types. 
                In practice, this is mostly useful for the "status.net" sites, including
                <a href="https://quitter.se" >Quitter</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/55" >Friendica</a>.

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/58" >Issue #58</a></change>
            <change>Added "Allow HTML content" option for each Microblogging system, 
                which allows to see formatted message content.
                Pump.io and StatusNet/Friendica support HTML formatting in messages.

            <change>Host of each Microblogging system may be configured. This may allow, for example, 
                connection to the Twitter sites through proxy server. On the other hand,

            <change>Fixed "Added accounts are lost when App is moved to SD Card"
                by adding to the AndroidManifest explicit declaration that AndStatus is allowed

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/21" >Issue #21</a>.
                In short: Losing application accounts after moving the app to SD card
                is expected Android system behavior.
                In order to address this limitation, AndStatus offers Storage - "Use External Storage"
                option for its data.

            Actually, previously existed support for the Twitter-compatible StatusNet API 
            was re-enabled with two additions: 1. The actual name of the StatusNet server
            is now customizable (it may be e.g. <a href="https://quitter.se/andstatus" >quitter.se</a> 
            or any compatible server). You may have several StatusNet accounts in AndStatus application, 
            but all of them should be on the same server. 2. Maximum number of characters

            you are following as an "account1", posts a note, which is more appropriate for discussion 
            (replying or reblogging) as your another identity: "account2". This allows your accounts 
            to be more focused (on one language, one topic etc.) and to avoid following the same user

In a case of many accounts it's becoming harder to check for new messages in each account.
A "Combined timeline" allows both read all new messages in one stream

even if they were downloaded from different systems.
The "Home Combined" timeline shows not only messages from "Home" timelines of all accounts, 
but also messages, downloaded during other requests: e.g. previous messages of Conversations.
You can do all usual operations with messages in the Combined Timeline, including favoriting,
replying and reblogging.

                User can easily switch timeline between accounts.</change>

                This is why new permissions were added.</change>
            <change>Fix for "Use External Storage" option for Android v.4.0.
                This fix forced us to compile package against Android v.4.0 (API 15).

        <changes>
            <change>"Native" Retweet implemented. Tweets retweeted in AndStatus
             are shown as "Retweeted" in twitter.com also.</change>
            <change>Home timeline shows authors of Retweets, not users who retweeted them.</change>
            <change>Underlying Data model has been totally redesigned in order to be able to 
            accommodate upcoming enhancements:
            1. Multiple user Accounts.
            2. Multiple Instant messaging systems (twitter.com, identi.ca etc.).
            3. References between messages (tweets, dents, statuses…), Users and Accounts.
            Unfortunately advanced SQL queries used in the code are not supported by the 
            SQLite engine built-in Android prior v.2.2 (API 8).
            This means that this updated application works only on Android v.2.2 and above.
            </change>
            <change>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission was added to the Manifest. 
            Otherwhise "Use External Storage" doesn't work (after compilation for API 8.

            Working offline or in bad connection conditions is
            implemented.
            Now User doesn't have to wait for the "Command execution
            on a Server" after updating his status (i.e. sending a tweet)
            and may continue reading and
            writing tweets, making them Favorite etc.
            while AndStatus stores all the
            commands in the queue and retries delivery
            upon every automatic update and also
            during any manual command (Reload or Status update).
            User is being notified about number of messages
            currently in the Output queue
            (If
            Notifications are being enabled).
