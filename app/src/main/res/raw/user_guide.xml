    <title>
        <p>1. Getting started</p>
    </title>
    <p>Tap "Get Started" button below: screen to add
        new account will be opened.
    </p>
    <p>First you will be prompted to select a type of a Social network, and then - an instance (a server)
        of the selected type. Several instances of each type are preconfigured.
    </p>
    <p>In case your ("GNU social"-type of) system is not listed,
        tap the "Discover open instances" menu item to pick a system
        from a live online list, maintained by the GNU social community;
        or "Add new system" manually prior to adding a new account.</p>
    <p>You will be prompted to type your Username and Password
        before you will be allowed to "Add this account".</p>
    <p>After successful creation of an account, please tap "left arrow"
        on an
        "Action bar" or "Back" button on your device.
        This time a Home Timeline will be opened,
        and messages for this account will start downloading from the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>Congratulations! Please read below about what you can do further.
    </p>
    <p>And don't forget to add AndStatus's widget to a Home screen of Your
        device:
        the widget will inform you about new messages and may be used to launch
        AndStatus.
    </p>

        <p>2. AndStatus basics</p>
    </title>
    <p>The first view of AndStatus (after at least one account has been added)
        contains a Home Timeline.
    </p>
    <p>In order to perform an action on a message in the list you
        should
        <strong>long press</strong>
        it to access its "Context menu".
    </p>
    <p>You may <strong>tap</strong>
        a message to get more details on it and to see
        the conversation tree to which the message belongs.
    </p>
    <p>Open the "Navigation Drawer" on the left and tap the current Timeline
        type item ("Home")
        to switch to the other views.
    </p>

        <p>3. Sending and replying</p>
    </title>
    <p>1. In order to update your status, tap the "Post" button.
        It resembles an "Envelope+".
        A message editor will open at the bottom of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>2. Enter your message content in the text area.
    </p>
    <p>3. Optionally, attach an image to your post. While the message Editor is visible,
        another button appears on an Action bar: "Paperclip+".
        (The "Attach" menu item may be hidden under an "Overflow" button: "three vertical dots").
        Tap the "Attach" button and select a picture. After successful attachment of the image,
        the text "(with media)" will appear below the text area, in which you're composing your message.
    </p>
    <p>4. Tap <strong>Send</strong> to send your message. If you are offline, the message will be
        put into a Queue to be automatically sent later. (Use "Commands in a queue" menu item
        to see your unsent messages in the Queue)
    </p>
    <p>In order to reply, <strong>tap and hold</strong>
        the desired message, then select <strong>Reply</strong>
        from the Context menu, and enter your reply at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>To abort a post or reply, simply tap the "Hide" button to hide the
       text area.</p>

        <p>4. Attached images: sending and showing</p>
    </title>
    <section>
        <title>
            <p>4.1. Sending images</p>
        </title>
        <p>First way to attach a picture to a post is described in a previous section: you can attach
            an image to a message, while creating the message.
        </p>
        <p>Another way to send an image is to "Share" it via AndStatus: here you start with an image
            from/in another app. For instance, you may want to snap a photo and send it to a social network.
            Do this:
        </p>
        <p>1. Take a picture / find it in a Gallery and click on the picture's thumbnail to open it.
        </p>
        <p>2. Select "Share" in the menu. Most apps contain the "Share" action...
        </p>
        <p>3. Select "AndStatus" from the list showing the apps that can share images.
        </p>
        <p>4. Now you're in AndStatus. If you have more than one account,
            select the desired one, otherwise, you will be immediately forwarded to
            the Message Editor.</p>
        <p>5. Now you are in the Message Editor, with the picture already attached
            (you should see the "(with media)" text above the message text box).
        </p>
        <p>6. Type any text and tap "Send". (It's not allowed to send an image without any text)
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>
            <p>4.2. Showing attached images</p>
        </title>
        <p>These settings are available in the Settings -> Attachments:</p>
        <p>1. The "Download and display attached images" checkbox. If it's unticked, attachments
            are not even downloaded thus conserving your network traffic.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that when you tick this option, images aren't shown instantly,
            because And Status still needs a moment to download them in the background.
        </p>
        <p>2. "Attach images to my messages". When "on", you can use "Paperclip+" button
            ("Attach" menu item) to attach images to your message.
            When "off", the "Paperclip", used to attach an image to your post, is hidden.
        </p>

    <title>
        <p>5. Private (direct) messages</p>
    </title>
    <p>Open a Navigation Drawer on a left, tap current Timeline type
        item (Home)
        and select
        <strong>Private</strong>
        from the list.
    </p>
    <p>In order to <strong>delete</strong>
        your message (public or private),
        <strong>hold down</strong> on it and select
        <strong>Remove message</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>New messages are fetched to timelines in the background
        if you have <strong>Automatic sync</strong> turned on
        in the Android "Account and Sync" settings for this
        AndStatus Account.
        In any case, you may always get updates from the Internet
        manually using the "Reload" command on the Action bar.
    </p>

    <title>
        <p>6. Mentions</p>
    </title>
    <p>Tap current Timeline type item in a Navigation Drawer
        and then select
        <strong>Mentions</strong>
        .
    </p>
    <p>Mentions will list every message that mentions your
        <strong>@username</strong>
        (or mentions any of your AndStatus accounts in the
        "combined" timeline).
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>
        <p>7. Search (local search)</p>
    </title>
    <p>Local search searches among messages already loaded from the
        Internet.
        Hence it is available even offline.
    </p>
    <p>1. In order to find any word or phrase in message texts,
        select <strong>Search</strong>
        on the Action bar or tap the dedicated
        <strong>Search</strong> button on your device.
    </p>
    <p>If you wish to show messages from a specific user,
        please search for "username".</p>
    <p>To see mentions of a specific User, search for "@username".
    </p>
    <p>2. To quickly search for messages by a user
        (the Author or the Sender of the selected message), select
        "Notes by UserName" from the message context menu.
        This is actually sort of a Global Search (see below).
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>
        <p>8. Global search</p>
    </title>
    <p>Global search function sends a search request directly to
        Social networks' servers.
        This is why live Internet connection to the networks is required.
    </p>
    <p>First, you are presented with the results of the Local search.
        In parallel, AndStatus downloads results
        from the Social network of the selected Account
        (or from all Social networks, if a Timeline is "combined").
        Search results are being updated upon receiving responses from the servers.
        In case of a connection error,
        e.g. no response from the server of the Social network,
        only results from the Local Search are shown.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that pump.io system doesn't support Global search yet.
    </p>
    <p>1. A global search for a word/phrase is initiated
        using its "Global search" item on the "Action bar".</p>
    <p>2. Another way to globally search for messages by the Author or Sender
        of the selected message is to select
        "Notes by UserName" from the Context menu of this message.</p>
