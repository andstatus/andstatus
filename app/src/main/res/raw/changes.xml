                In a case automatically syncable timeline fails with UNAUTHORIZED response, account is marked as failed.

        <changes>
            <change>Current account should always correspond to the selected timeline. I.e. it cannot be from
                another Social Network. On app start current account should be the one that belongs to current
                timeline (i.e. to the Default timeline).<br/>
                Show my account's avatar on an Action bar of a timeline in a case the timeline is for current account.

        <changes>
            <change>Support OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414).<br/>
                According to "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata" (RFC 8414)
                before starting OAuth authorization AndStatus client tries to obtain OAuth endpoints from
                "/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server" path. This change allows using ActivityPub
                with servers that have OAuth endpoints different from Mastodon's.

                a participant of this conversation.</change>
            <change>Sooner retries of throttled downloads:
                Throttled commands can be retried after the required delay period passed.
                Before this change the whole retry queue was processed periodically
                without looking at each command's "timeToRetry".

            <change>Fix adding Twitter Account. It appeared that Twitter doesn't like "AndStatus" user agent anymore.
                This is ID of the app's internal web browser that worked for more than 10 years...</change>

        versionTitle="Animated images and Video preview. User's preferred screen orientation">
        <changes>
            <change>For Android 9+ only: Animations of animated images are shown by default.
                Both in attachments and in avatars.
                GIF and WebP are supported.
                Settings -&gt; Appearance -&gt; "Show image animations" option allows to turn this behavior off.
                It appears that currently only ActivityPub (implemented by Pleroma) and Pump.io networks
                (i.e. server parts of them) support WebP and keep GIFs as is.
                Other servers simply reject WebP and convert GIFs to video...
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/330">#330</a></change>
            <change>Animated image and video on Twitter is shown as a preview image with a "Play" button
                on it. This is the same behavior as for other social networks.</change>
            <change>"Play" button on a video preview image is moved to the bottom corner
                to allow better view of the image.</change>
            <change>Screen orientation is not "unspecified", as before,
                but "The user's current preferred orientation" that is set by a User for the whole Android device.
                In particular, this allows to use landscape mode on smartphones (and not on tablets only, as before).</change>
            <change>Added "App instance name" setting to help identifying AndStatus backups.</change>

        <changes>
            <change>Show numbers of likes, replies and reblogs for Mastodon; likes and retweets for Twitter.
                Added similar to #ActivityPub #C2S, hope the same counters will be supported there also.
            </change>
            <change>Added Actors's name ("Real name") as a separate field to Actor's profile.
                Created landscape layout for Actor's profile.</change>

                Just type (host of) instance and proceed to Log in.

        versionTitle="Avatars and attachments syncing performance improved">
        <changes>
            <change>Since its creation years ago AndStatus used only one background process (thread)
                to post and to download information from the Internet.
                Images downloads were considered low priority tasks,
                so avatars and attachments appeared noticeably later than text of a timeline,
                especially when multiple timelines and accounts were synced one after one.<br />
                With this release a separate process is responsible for images downloading, so overall syncing
                performance improvement should be visible.

        <changes>
            <change>Implemented receiving Private ("Direct") notes from Mastodon. It appeared that such notes
                should be queried from a Server via a separate timeline (just like in Twitter and GNU Social).

        versionTitle="ActivityPub Client to Server improvements">
        <changes>
            <change>This release was focused on supporting new and improved #ActivityPub features that appeared both
                in #Pleroma and, surprisingly, in #Mastodon also. You can really start experimenting with
                ActivityPub social network type if you have an account at Pleroma site with latest v.2.x Pleroma builds...
                Posting with image attachments works.
            </change>
            <change>Mastodon (not AndStatus!) doesn't give you enough features to switch client connection to
                ActivityPub simply because Home timeline and posting via ActivityPub connection is not supported yet
                (corresponding pages give 404 Not found error).<br/>
                But you can see our own posts on Mastodon servers and navigate to other Actors and their post via them
                (you can see profiles of other Actors and see their posts...). You can even play with Mastodon
                as an "ActivityPub" type Social network in AndStatus today!
                But prepare to see empty Home timeline and to be read-only there for now.
                Switch to "Sent" timeline and see your Actor's posts, see other actors and their posts similarly...<br/>
                These new Mastodon improvements make me very optimistic about the future
                of ActivityPub in client apps across all server platforms.
            </change>
            <change>Some important fixes, including more Avatars and Images will be shown.</change>
            <change>More convenience for developers. Logging of network level messages (including response headers)
            improved. Even file names with responses are much clearer now, e.g.
            2020-04-25-03-34-51-663_social.tulsa.ok.us-oauth_register_client_response.json or
            2020-04-25-03-35-02-235_mastodon.technology-get_actor_response.json (real names from my log).
            Remember that logs are stored for 10 days and can be optionally included in a Backup!<br/>
            Server developers, please use AndStatus as your testing client!</change>

        <changes>
            <change>Each Note now has "Public", "to Followers" or "Private" words under the Note's text.
                And this works for Mastodon, ActivityPub and Pump.io Social networks.
                Private Notes are not a special kind of posts, they are just sent to explicitly mentioned
                recipients only.

                properly...

        <changes>
            <change>During Note composition we can now explicitly set <i>Public</i> and <i>Followers</i> groups
                as the Note recipients.
                Combination of the two groups' checkboxes corresponds to Mastodon's "Status privacy" (visibility) options:<br/>
                Mastodon calls "private" messages, for which "Public" checkbox is cleared.<br/>
                And it calls "Direct" messages, for which
                "Followers" checkbox is cleared also (and thus the note/status will be sent only to users,
                mentioned in the note's body).
            </change>
            <change>Addressing notes to Public and Followers groups is explicitly shown in timelines.
                This is shown, in particular, for Mastodon notes.

        versionTitle="The first step of Groups support">
        <changes>
            <change>Groups as a kind of "Actors" appeared. Group's timeline type added.
                Actual groups as kind of recipients are now discovered in GNU Social notes
                by "!groupname" references. #AndStatus can discover groups in previously downloaded notes using
                "Settings - Thoubleshooting - Check and fix data" procedure (that may be quite long though...).
                We're expecting to extend Groups support in #GNUSocial, #ActivityPub, etc. as server-side developers
                extend related client-to-server APIs...
                More details and discussion are here:

             versionTitle="Merging actors of Users from different Social Networks. New Interactions timeline">
        <changes>
            <change>Actors having the same WebFingerId (e.g. "andstatus@loadaverage.org") in different social networks
                are merged logically. This allows AndStatus to show you in one timeline activities of one actor, downloaded
                via different instances. This is especially needed for GNU Social and Mastodon.<br/>
                Please note that for Pump.io this feature is provided for years, because all Pump.io instances use
                the same actorID (WebFingerId) for the same actor.
            </change>
            <change><i>Mentions</i> timeline is replaced by <i>Interactions</i>, which shows not only "mentions" and replies,
                but also likes, reposts and followers. Basically "Interactions" timeline shows all interactions of other
                users with us (our actors) whereas "Notifications" timeline shows us only those interactions, which we
                preferred to be notified about in Settings &gt; Notifications, plus unsent notes.</change>
            <change>Names of things in the User interface (mostly) changed according to the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">ActivityPub</a>
                recommendation. In particular, now we use the word "note" for tweets/toots/notices.<br/>
                And the words "Actor" and "User" have different meanings (In ActivityPub, a user is represented by "actors"
                via the user's accounts on servers. User's accounts on different servers correspond to different actors.)
                Most of Timelines in AndStatus show <i>Activities</i> now instead of Notes.

             versionTitle="Activities instead of messages, and enhancements of Notifications">
        <changes>
            <change>This is a major change of AndStatus, which is available for Android 7.0+ devices only
                and which may require quite a long database upgrade on the first run after the upgrade.</change>
            <change>The whole internal data model of the application has changed from working with "messages" to working
                with "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">activities</a>",
                allowing to present social networks in a richer way and to solve many old problems.
                E.g. after reblogging of a message the message doesn't "jump" to the top of a timeline, as before:
                now you see a new "Reblog action" for this message at the top the timeline.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/172">#172</a><br/>
                The same for Like/Favorite and Follow/"Stop following" actions.<br/>
                Usage of this feature to its full potential requires its support in a Social network. As of now only
                Pump.io fully supports <i>activities</i>; Mastodon sends activities in its "Notifications" timeline only.<br/>
                For legacy server timelines that contain messages only, AndStatus also presents Reblogs as activities,
                because a "Reblog" _is_ an action even in "Twitter-like" implementations.
                "Notes" from legacy timelines are interpreted as
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-update" target="_blank">Update actions</a>
                of these messages.<br/>
                Please note that an Actor on separate line also has a separate context menu, related to him.
            </change>
            <change>Direct messages and timelines renamed to Private with corresponding changes in their content.</change>
            <change>"Notifications" timeline added, which shows
                <i><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">activities</a></i> that are
                configured to be notified about in AndStatus Settings -&gt; Notifications. You can be notified about:
                Followers, Favorites, Mentions, Reblogs, unset messages in the Outbox and about Private messages.

                These notifications are persisted even after device reboot. Notifications are reset
                when a User opens correspondent timeline e.g. by clicking on the Notification or a Widget.

                In addition to a number of new events (activities/messages), notifications now show an Account
                (in a case a notification is for one account only) and time, when the last event occurred.

                for a long time. Despite Android specifications, I noticed that e.g. my new Lenovo tablet doesn't wake up
                for a "maintenance window" and Android system initiated background syncing could never occur.
                So additional timer introduced to check for missed sync events and initiate syncing if necessary.

            <change>AndStatus now can download older messages of a Timeline. When a User have scrolled down to the oldest

                which allows to request next page of older messages from a server.
                This may seem like a must have feature, but due to ability to store previously downloaded messages as long
                as a User wishes, it was not frequently requested. In fact, ability to view older messages may be needed
                mostly during the first day-two of AndStatus application usage, when there is not much data stored yet.

                he/she is prompted to select a "Type of Social Network" first. After this selection only social Networks
                of the selected type are shown. Actually, only one Social Network of Twitter and of Pump.io types
                are preconfigured after installation, so there is no need to select the only instance. But there are 7
                preconfigured instances of GNU Social servers. Additional "Social networks" may be added by a User.

        <changes>
            <change>Conversation view opens much faster now. This is because messages, which belong to one
                conversation, are calculated beforehand in a background.

            <change>For "GNU Social" additional conversation performance improvement implemented:
                special "getConversation API" is used to download the whole conversation from a server
                in one request instead of downloading messages mostly one-by-one, as for other social networks.

            <change>Search for all words and for exact phrases implemented.<br/>
                If you type several words in a search box,
                AndStatus now searches for the messages, which contain all typed words in any order.
                In order to search for an exact phrase, enclose it in double quotes.<br/>
                In a case of a Global search, your query string is sent to a Social network server exactly as you typed it.
                It turns out that GNU Social and Twitter interprets the query just like described above,
                which means that Global search for all words and phrases (without punctuation) works also.

            <change>One "Reply to all” action is replaced with two: ”Reply to conversation participants" (what we actually had

                to whom you are replying, and all users, mentioned in the body of the replied message.

            <change>Implemented "Private conversation with selected recipient". Now clicking
                "Open conversation" on a Direct message (for GNU Social and Twitter) opens a list
                of messages between the two recipients. Pump.io supports private conversations
                natively, so for Pump.io "Reply" to a Direct message is now enabled, which allows to
                have different "conversations" with the same recipient (as for public conversations).

            <change>Share a message with its attachment.<br/>
                "Share" message context menu item shares not only textual part of the message,
                as before, but the attached image also. This way a message with an attachment can
                be shared from one Social Network to another within AndStatus, or to some note
                taking application, e.g. to
                <a href="https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes">Omni Notes</a>,
                where it will be stored with the attachment.

                This button may help new users to notice existence of the context menu.
                It also may be used in a case you set "Long click to open context menu" option

                Messages with and without attachments can be edited. A User can change
                both text and an attached image. What is not supported (and will fail on an attempt
                to send an update): adding an attachment to a message that didn't have one.
                Or removing an attachment. This is because messages
                with and without attachments are two different types of objects in Pump.io.<br/>
                "Edit" context menu item appears, when a Sender is my account and it is successfully
                verified (i.e. the account can actually post the update).

                We already have "Get User Information" for a User, which allows to update the User's
                information, including information on Friends and Followers .
                Similarly, the "Get Message Information" action allows to update information
                on replies, likes and reblogs / retweets / shares.
                In particular, for Pump.io this feature allows, in addition, retrieve Replies

        <changes>
            <change>Implemented ”Collapse duplicates” feature, which is switchable in the Navigation
                Drawer of a Timeline. This allows to see several crossposted messages as one entry
                in a Timeline.<br/>
                When duplicated posts are collapsed (by default),
                visible "main" post shows number of hidden duplicated posts as e.g. ”(+3)".<br/>
                When ”Collapse duplicates” checkbox is checked, a User can "Show/Hide duplicates" of
                any individual message via its context menu. This may be needed e.g. to follow a
                discussion in a Social Network whose (duplicated) message was hidden ("collapsed").

            <change>Accounts reodering implemented. Reorder accounts using drag-and-drop in a new
                "Manage Accounts" view. The topmost account becomes the "Default account".<br/>
                This sorting order of accounts is used everywhere in the application, including
                showing in the "Select account" dialog and making a decision, what message to show
                among several collapsed duplicates...
            </change>
            <change>In order to ease navigation in a Timeline, "Top", "1", "2", "3" and positions
                of three first shown messages are displayed in the top right corner of a message.
                This frees a User from unnecessary attempts to scroll a list.<br/>
                "1" means that this message is the topmost currently shown, but there may be more
                messages in the local cache (i.e. already downloaded to your Device).<br/>
                "Top" shown instead of "1" means that there are no newer messages downloaded, and
                an attempt to "pull to refresh" will result in "sync with Internet".
            </change>
            <change>If not set explicitly in the "Manage Timelines" view, Home Timeline of the
                Default Account is now the Default Timeline - it opens on the Application launch.
                This is natural for new users and simplifies initial configuration.</change>

                Individual timelines can now be managed separately in the "Manage Timelines" table
                (in a menu of a list of messages and also in Settings->Timeline).

                For each timeline sync statistics is shown:<br/>
                * Number of syncs and accumulated numbers of all downloaded and of new messages.<br/>
                * Time of last successful and of last failed syncs.<br/>

                which were sent after the last downloaded message, i.e. just like it does with
                "Don't synchronize old messages..." option turned off.<br/>
                A User sets a value for this option in hours, i.e. "1" or "100" ...
                Empty value or "0" mean that the option is turned off (default behaviour).

                In order to open Context Menu of a message,  tap on an Avatar or on any text without
                a link.<br/>
                Please note that sometimes two taps on a message text are needed to open a Context
                Menu. We understand this a sort of trade-off, which we had to accept by making links
                clickable. Anyway, tap on an Avatar or on a User name works from the first tap.

            <change>Added &quot;Action bar text and icon color&quot; option to

                &quot;White&quot; (default) and &quot;Black&quot;. This allows to have

                These lists are synced manually and simultaneously

                action to populate or update the list for a selected User.

                So, from now on, by default context menus are opened by Tap
                (&quot;Single click&quot;) on an item. Tapping on a User's avatar is the most
                reliable gesture. Tapping a body of a message in a Timeline does the same,
                but in a Conversation view links in a message body become clickable, so tap may
                launch an Internet Browser or open a Context menu, depending on exact place,
                where a User clicked message body.<br/>

                Now AndStatus loads not more than 100 messages (a &quot;page&quot;) at a time,
                and it keeps in its memory not more than 5 pages at a time.
                When a User scrolls in any direction and new pages are loaded,
                farther pages are discarded.

            <change>With this release AndStatus opens a new view for exploration of social
                networks: a &quot;User List&quot;.<br/>
                For years, a &quot;Timeline&quot;, holding list of messages (posts, tweets...),
                was the only representation of Social networks in AndStatus. Most of information about
                members of these networks was hidden. Now we do have a list, where Users
                and information about them is the main content.<br/>
                As with Timelines, there will be different kinds of &quot;User Lists&quot;.
                &quot;Users of message&quot; is the first: it can be opened via a message's
                context menu, and it shows a list, containing not only an Author, a User whom
                the message was addressed to, and rebloggers. It also lists all users mentioned
                in a body of the message.<br/>
                But the main point here is that you can act on these users via new context menu:
                see their profiles in the Internet,
                visit their Homepages, follow and stop following them. More actions will be
                added based on your feedback. Read more and discuss at

                New behavior on message load: If a message is not a Reply to another message,
                AndStatus checks if the message's body starts with @username and marks it as a Reply
                to a User with this username. So such &quot;Replies to a User&quot;
                are also filtered by this option.

            <change>Fixed: gnusocial.no, quitter.no, quitter.es and some other servers didn't
                allow sending attachments via AndStatus due to HTTP protocol incompatibility.
                &quot;Use legacy HTTP protocol&quot; option added to a Social network editor
                to allow posting images to such servers. Default &quot;Auto&quot;
                value may not always work, so setting &quot;Use legacy HTTP protocol&quot;
                to &quot;Yes&quot; is recommended for these servers.

        <changes>
            <change>Implemented discovery of open GNU Social instances (servers)
                using the new &quot;get_open_instances&quot;
                <a href="http://gstools.org/api/doc/">gstools.org API</a>.
                From now on there is no need to have all open instances
                preconfigured in AndStatus:
                a User may select new &quot;Microblogging system&quot;
                from a live list, downloaded via an online service.
                We hope that this feature will stimulate GNU social instance owners to
                register in this discovery service.

        <changes>
            <change>Fixed undesirable merge of Users with the same nicknames [StatusNet]. This is
                actual for the cases, <br/>
                1) When messages by users with the same nickname exist in one instance
                (e.g. when the users' profiles are at different servers).<br/>
                2) When a User changes their nickname.<br/>
                This feature is implemented by comparing not Nicknames, as before, but WebFinger IDs
                of users.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/125" >Issue #125</a>.</change>

                Setting it to &quot;off&quot; allows inserting newline

        <changes>
            <change>Application data backup and restore implemented. This feature may be used in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual backup at any time to SD card (Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Backup application
                        data) and manual restore after reinstall: from the first screen and from
                        Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Restore application data.</li>
                    <li>Automatic backup and restore by Android system. This may work for some devices,
                        but currently is useless for the most users due to Android system internal limitations
                        (see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/pull/49" >this discussion</a>).</li>
                </ul>
                Preferences, messages and accounts with their credentials are backed up. Avatars are not.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/86" >Issue #86</a>.</change>
            <change>&quot;Sync while using application&quot; option added (turned on by default, as it was earlier).
                When this option is turned off (in Settings-&gt;Syncing),
                there is no background sync while browsing timeline and conversations
                in order to preserve smoothness of scrolling. Manually initiated updates
                occur in background though.</change>
            <change>AndStatus syncing indicator is added to the Timeline screen.
                To turn this feature off,
                go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Syncing indicator on timeline.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/63" >Issue #63</a>.</change>
            <change>Added an option to change Connection timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds.
                (go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Connection timeout)
                Increasing this value may improve connections with slow servers.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/83" >Issue #83</a>.</change>
            <change>Overflow button added to Action bars of Activities, which have Options menues.</change>
            <change>BOOT_COMPLETED permission added in order to update a Widget after boot.</change>
            <change>Due to incompatibility with changed Twitter site behavior, addition of new Twitter
                accounts is allowed only for Android v.4.2. and higher. You may workaround this using
                backup/restore. See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/92" >Issue #92</a></change>

            <change>"Public" Timeline added to the list of available timelines.
                The latest messages from the Public Timeline may be fetched on demand
                for StatusNet-type microblogging systems via "Reload" context menu item.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/73" >Issue #73</a>.
                Public timeline is per a Microblogging system, not per an Account.</change>
            <change>Context menu on Public Timeline has a "Global search" item,
                allowing searching messages online for Twitter and StatusNet-type systems
                (requires Internet connection). <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/503" >Pump.io
                    doesn't have a global search service yet</a>.<br/>
                Thus the Public timeline shows both messages, "Reloaded" from Public Timeline directly,
                and messages, retrieved via: "Global Search", "Messages by this User" and Messages,
                automatically retrieved for Conversation trees.</change>
            <change>Options menu in Account activity allows to open Settings

            <change>In the presence of background operations the Timeline is now operating smoothly
                and doesn't freeze. Potentially long operations moved to the background thread.

            <change>Spanish translation added, thanks to <a href="https://identi.ca/susobaco" >Suso Comesaña</a></change>
            <change>Fixed "Preserve screen position after content update". As a Timeline is being
                updated in the background, new messages don't cause unexpected list scrolling any more.

                from the "Microblogging System" of one of these types.
                Names of these systems are currently: "Twitter" , "pump.io" , and lots of systems
                of the status.net type with their own Names and Hosts, e.g. "Quitter" at the "quitter.se"
                host, "Friendica" at some of its hosts ("hubs") etc.
                Now User may create any number of "Microblogging systems" of the three existing types.
                In practice, this is mostly useful for the "status.net" sites, including
                <a href="https://quitter.se" >Quitter</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/55" >Friendica</a>.

            <change>Added "Allow HTML content" option for each Microblogging system,
                which allows to see formatted message content.
                Pump.io and StatusNet/Friendica support HTML formatting in messages.

                In short: Losing application accounts after moving the app to SD card
                is expected Android system behavior.
                In order to address this limitation, AndStatus offers Storage - "Use External Storage"

            see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/37" >Issue #37</a>.
            Actually, previously existed support for the Twitter-compatible StatusNet API
            was re-enabled with two additions: 1. The actual name of the StatusNet server
            is now customizable (it may be e.g. <a href="https://quitter.se/andstatus" >quitter.se</a>
            or any compatible server). You may have several StatusNet accounts in AndStatus application,
            but all of them should be on the same server. 2. Maximum number of characters
            in the message is being read from the server's configuration.</change>

            AndStatus adds one more item to the message context menu, allowing you "to act as..." another
            account on the same message. This feature may be very convenient when e.g. one of the users
            you are following as an "account1", posts a note, which is more appropriate for discussion
            (replying or reblogging) as your another identity: "account2". This allows your accounts
            to be more focused (on one language, one topic etc.) and to avoid following the same user
            by more than one of your accounts.</change>

            which now is a part of the federated, distributed pump.io social network.
            AndStatus sees the whole network as one Microblogging system supporting user accounts
            from all its nodes not limiting to the identi.ca site only.
            After installation of this app version old identi.ca accounts and data

        <changes><change>Timeline synchronization is greatly improved because now Android itself does

            As a result of this change, &quot;Automatic updates&quot; setting was removed from preferences.

            The timeline has messages from the cache which are shown immediately.
            The "Reload" options menu loads the timeline from the Internet. If you have "Automatic updates"

                At the same time, in order to comply with Twitter "Developer Display Requirements", we will use alternative

            <change>Combined timeline added.
                In a case of many accounts it's becoming harder to check for new messages in each account.
                A "Combined timeline" allows both read all new messages in one stream
                and search for all messages stored locally in all accounts,
                even if they were downloaded from different systems.
                The "Home Combined" timeline shows not only messages from "Home" timelines of all accounts,
                but also messages, downloaded during other requests: e.g. previous messages of Conversations.
                You can do all usual operations with messages in the Combined Timeline, including favoriting,
                replying and reblogging.

                Working offline or in bad connection conditions is
                implemented.
                Now User doesn't have to wait for the "Command execution
                on a Server" after updating his status (i.e. sending a tweet)
                and may continue reading and
                writing tweets, making them Favorite etc.
                while AndStatus stores all the
                commands in the queue and retries delivery
                upon every automatic update and also
                during any manual command (Reload or Status update).
                User is being notified about number of messages
                currently in the Output queue
                (If
                Notifications are being enabled).
                Queues of unsent commands persist in the phone's memory.
                Even after shutdown for Android v.1.6 and up.</change>
            <change>Changes in the application permissions.
                Two (location)
                permissions were removed, one permission was added
                to help
                asynchronous message delivery (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).</change>
            <change>Improved user experience during initial configuration till first tweets loading</change>
            <change>"Verify" preference moved to the top of the "User
                Credentials"
                preference's
                section, because User can really start from tapping it
                (typing Username is not required for OAuth)!</change>
            <change>Widget shows last time when data was successfully
                downloaded from the server, not when there was last attempt to do
                this (maybe it failed…)</change>
            <change>New Preference "Minimum logging level" added to allow changing
                Logging level from within the application Preferences.</change>
            <change>Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndStatus's
                timelines open

                1. Queued tweet sending implemented. Now User doesn't
                have to wait for the "Command execution on a Server"
                and may continue reading and writing tweets.
                Moreover, the same "(close to the) Guaranteed message delivery"
                approach works
                for the other commands also: Timeline reload,
                Favorites creation and deletion.
                AndStatus retries to send commands to the server on every
                automatic update and during any manual command or message
                (Reload or Status update). User is being notified
                about number of messages currently in the queue
                (If Notifications are being enabled).

                4. Made first step in switching from parallel
                and, in fact, synchronous requests (Twitter commands) processing to
                the sequential and queued processing, see {@link
