            <change>Backup feature enhancements simplify application's testing and troubleshooting. Now AndStatus allows
                to backup current data, then do reinstalls and experiments with other versions and settings. And finally
                restore everything to the same or any other device as it was before the first backup.

        <changes>
            <change>Size of downloaded files/streams is controlled during download, and not after download completion,
                as before. This allows to stop downloading a file (or reading a timeline),
                which appeared to be larger than configured "Maximum size of an attachment"</change>
            <change>If attachments are configured to be downloaded via Wi-Fi only: During download, AndStatus checks
                periodically, if Wi-Fi connection is still active.
                In case Wi-Fi connection is lost, the download is interrupted and will be retried later.

        <changes>
            <change>Fixed: Default notification sound was heard even if set to Silent in Settings.
                This was caused by changed rules after starting to target Android 9.<br/>
                Any Android notification (including Vibration and Sound) should show an icon in Notification Area
                (Android 9 restriction).

             versionTitle="Unread Notifications and improved HTML support">
        <changes>
            <change>Added the "Unread notifications" timeline, sorted by the time of download ("received ... minutes ago"),
                so it is easy to see new activities. Moreover, the timeline has "Mark all as read" button to explicitly
                instruct #AndStatus to not notify about all currently shown activities anymore.</change>
            <change>Improved handling of HTML-formatted content. "Escaped" characters are (mostly...) correctly preserved
                now, especially if created by this User.<br/>
                Notes are shared in HTML format.<br/>
                Working towards <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">ActivityPub</a>

             versionTitle="Links to mentioned users and to hashtags are opened in AndStatus">
        <changes>
            <change>Plain text notes are linkified: mentions are linked to User's "Sent" timelines; hashtags are linked to
                Search timelines of these hashtags.
                Existing links of mentions and hashtags in HTML notes are replaced with in-client links also.<br/>
                Added "CheckAudience" step to Troubleshooting -> "Check and fix data".
                Applying this fixing procedure allows to have clicks on mentions opened in AndStatus even for older notes.

             versionTitle="Fixed: Blank space, when there is no an attachment">
        <changes>
            <change>Fixed: Users were confused by blank space below a note's text, when there is no an attachment.
                It was present, when the note contained non-image attachments.</change>
            <change>"Logging and debugging" section renamed to "Troubleshooting".
                "Check and fix data" action in Settings moved to the "Troubleshooting" section.</change>

             versionTitle="Search by a part of a word. Avatars fixed.">
        <changes>
            <change>Search works for a note's name (title) and a content. You have to launch "AndStatus Settings
            -> Storage -> Check and fix data" once to rebuild search index in existing local cache.</change>
            <change>Added Search and filtering by a part of a word. Now you can type e.g. <b>contains:other</b>
                to match "other" and "mother" or you can search for <b>contains://andstatus.org/</b> to filter posts,
                which contain links in "andstatus.org" domain.

        <changes>
            <change>Hide Note Editor and save Draft on BACK device key.</change>
            <change>Note Editor can cycle between three layouts: Default, Maximizing the Editor,
                Showing Timeline with the Editor.<br/> The layout switch occur on clicking above or below editable text
                in the Editor (e.g. on clicking text of the "in reply to" note).
                Divider between the Editor and a Timeline made more noticeable to avoid User's confusion.

             versionTitle="Favoriting activity in GNU Social and Limiting image cache size">
        <changes>
            <change>GNU Social sends favoriting activity as an ordinary note
                with "somebody favorited something by otheruser:" <i>favoriting prefix</i> (or as
                "oneman favourited a status by somebody@somewhere.org)".
                AndStatus detects such notes during downloading and automatically converts them into LIKE (favoriting)
                activities, removing the favoriting prefix.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/491">#491</a>
            </change>
            <change>Added two options to limit total size of cached images and maximum size of any single image
                (to be sent or received):<br/><ul>
                    <li>Storage -&gt; "Maximum size of cached images, Mb" with a default value of 1000 Mb.</li>
                    <li>Attachments -&gt; "Maximum size of an attachment, Mb" with a default value of 5 Mb.</li>

        <changes>
            <change>User's profile is shown at the top of their timelines: "Sent" (Notes by "someuser@somedomain").
                For "my accounts" only: in "Favorites", "Friends" and "Followers" timelines also.
                Lists of user's friends and followers are available via the profile's context menu.

            </change>
            <change>Switching between accounts made more like in other Android applications, with avatars of current
                and two previously selected accounts in the Navigation drawer (like e.g. in GMail app).
                Clicking on current account's avatar opens their "Sent" timeline with the account's profile information

        <changes>
            <change>Video file can be attached to a new note. A thumbnail of the video attachment is shown in a timeline.
                Video attachment may be viewed the same way as an image attachment.
            </change>
            <change>Added titles (names) for notes of Pump.io and Mastodon (where they are called "CW").
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/150">#150</a></change>
            <change>Added "Public" checkbox to the Note Editor to mark a note explicitly as public or not
                public. Currently this option is available for Pump.io only.</change>
            <change>Click on an attached image or video opens corresponding viewer/player application.</change>
            <change>Added an option for "Collapse duplicates" that allows it to find not only adjacent duplicates
                ("distance" = 1), but also duplicates, separated by other notes:
                Timeline -> "Maximum distance between duplicates" which defaults to "5" now.
                Setting it to 0 disables the "Collapse duplicates" feature.

             versionTitle="Merging actors of Users from different Social Networks. New Interactions timeline">
        <changes>
            <change>Actors having the same WebFingerId (e.g. "andstatus@loadaverage.org") in different social networks
                are merged logically. This allows AndStatus to show you in one timeline activities of one actor, downloaded
                via different instances. This is especially needed for GNU Social and Mastodon.<br/>
                Please note that for Pump.io this feature is provided for years, because all Pump.io instances use
                the same actorID (WebFingerId) for the same actor.
            </change>
            <change><i>Mentions</i> timeline is replaced by <i>Interactions</i>, which shows not only "mentions" and replies,
                but also likes, reposts and followers. Basically "Interactions" timeline shows all interactions of other
                users with us (our actors) whereas "Notifications" timeline shows us only those interactions, which we
                preferred to be notified about in Settings &gt; Notifications, plus unsent notes.</change>
            <change>Names of things in the User interface (mostly) changed according to the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">ActivityPub</a>
                recommendation. In particular, now we use the word "note" for tweets/toots/notices.<br/>
                And the words "Actor" and "User" have different meanings (In ActivityPub, a user is represented by "actors"
                via the user's accounts on servers. User's accounts on different servers correspond to different actors.)
                Most of Timelines in AndStatus show <i>Activities</i> now instead of Notes.

             versionTitle="Activities instead of messages, and enhancements of Notifications">
        <changes>
            <change>This is a major change of AndStatus, which is available for Android 7.0+ devices only
                and which may require quite a long database upgrade on the first run after the upgrade.</change>
            <change>The whole internal data model of the application has changed from working with "messages" to working
                with "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">activities</a>",
                allowing to present social networks in a richer way and to solve many old problems.
                E.g. after reblogging of a message the message doesn't "jump" to the top of a timeline, as before:
                now you see a new "Reblog action" for this message at the top the timeline.
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/172">#172</a><br/>
                The same for Like/Favorite and Follow/"Stop following" actions.<br/>
                Usage of this feature to its full potential requires its support in a Social network. As of now only
                Pump.io fully supports <i>activities</i>; Mastodon sends activities in its "Notifications" timeline only.<br/>
                For legacy server timelines that contain messages only, AndStatus also presents Reblogs as activities,
                because a "Reblog" _is_ an action even in "Twitter-like" implementations.
                "Notes" from legacy timelines are interpreted as
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-update" target="_blank">Update actions</a>
                of these messages.<br/>
                Please note that an Actor on separate line also has a separate context menu, related to him.
            </change>
            <change>Direct messages and timelines renamed to Private with corresponding changes in their content.</change>
            <change>"Notifications" timeline added, which shows
                <i><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview" target="_blank">activities</a></i> that are
                configured to be notified about in AndStatus Settings -&gt; Notifications. You can be notified about:
                Followers, Favorites, Mentions, Reblogs, unset messages in the Outbox and about Private messages.
            </change>
            <change>Notifications, shown in Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html"

            <change>AndStatus now can download older messages of a Timeline. When a User have scrolled down to the oldest

                which allows to request next page of older messages from a server.
                This may seem like a must have feature, but due to ability to store previously downloaded messages as long
                as a User wishes, it was not frequently requested. In fact, ability to view older messages may be needed
                mostly during the first day-two of AndStatus application usage, when there is not much data stored yet.

                of the selected type are shown. Actually, only one Social Network of Twitter and of Pump.io types
                are preconfigured after installation, so there is no need to select the only instance. But there are 7
                preconfigured instances of GNU Social servers. Additional "Social networks" may be added by a User.

            <change>For "GNU Social" additional conversation performance improvement implemented:
                special "getConversation API" is used to download the whole conversation from a server
                in one request instead of downloading messages mostly one-by-one, as for other social networks.

            <change>Search for all words and for exact phrases implemented.<br/>
                If you type several words in a search box,
                AndStatus now searches for the messages, which contain all typed words in any order.
                In order to search for an exact phrase, enclose it in double quotes.<br/>
                In a case of a Global search, your query string is sent to a Social network server exactly as you typed it.
                It turns out that GNU Social and Twitter interprets the query just like described above,
                which means that Global search for all words and phrases (without punctuation) works also.

            <change>One "Reply to all” action is replaced with two: ”Reply to conversation participants" (what we actually had
                before as "Reply to all") and "Reply to mentioned users”. "Reply to mentioned users”, naturally, includes a User,
                to whom you are replying, and all users, mentioned in the body of the replied message.

                This button may help new users to notice existence of the context menu.
                It also may be used in a case you set "Long click to open context menu" option
                in Settings -&gt; Gestures.

            <change>Implementation of Pump.io's "share" activity made more familiar for accustomed
                Pump'io users:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Reblog" action for Pump.io account is renamed to "Share via Pump.io".
                        (Simply "Share" already has another meaning in AndStatus and
                        in Android in general for millions of users...).
                        This is similar to Twitter, for which the same
                        action is renamed in a User Interface to "Retweet".</li>
                    <li>No recipients are added to the activity.</li>

                This is a server, that decides in almost all cases, if a message is public or not.
                Now "Public" is added to "to" field for "post" activity only in a case no other
                recipients are found and if the message is not a reply.
            </change>

                Edit message [Pump.io]<br />
                Messages with and without attachments can be edited. A User can change
                both text and an attached image. What is not supported (and will fail on an attempt
                to send an update): adding an attachment to a message that didn't have one.
                Or removing an attachment. This is because messages
                with and without attachments are two different types of objects in Pump.io.<br/>
                "Edit" context menu item appears, when a Sender is my account and it is successfully
                verified (i.e. the account can actually post the update).

            <change>

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/418">#418</a>.<br/>
                We already have "Get User Information" for a User, which allows to update the User's
                information, including information on Friends and Followers .
                Similarly, the "Get Message Information" action allows to update information
                on replies, likes and reblogs / retweets / shares.
                In particular, for Pump.io this feature allows, in addition, retrieve Replies
                to this message in order to see them in a Conversation view, see

                Actual text transformation is done in literary 3 lines of code using Android system
                libraries. This gives an advantage of using better algorithm at each subsequent
                version of Android libraries. Emails are not HTMLified.

            <change>Size of text in Account and Timeline selectors enlarged.
                Now it's the same as a body text of messages (and hence it can be changed in

             versionTitle="Collapse duplicated posts. Accounts reodering. Continuous automatic application quality checking">
        <changes>
            <change>Implemented ”Collapse duplicates” feature, which is switchable in the Navigation
                Drawer of a Timeline. This allows to see several crossposted messages as one entry
                in a Timeline.<br/>
                When duplicated posts are collapsed (by default),
                visible "main" post shows number of hidden duplicated posts as e.g. ”(+3)".<br/>
                When ”Collapse duplicates” checkbox is checked, a User can "Show/Hide duplicates" of
                any individual message via its context menu. This may be needed e.g. to follow a
                discussion in a Social Network whose (duplicated) message was hidden ("collapsed").

            <change>Accounts reodering implemented. Reorder accounts using drag-and-drop in a new
                "Manage Accounts" view. The topmost account becomes the "Default account".<br/>
                This sorting order of accounts is used everywhere in the application, including
                showing in the "Select account" dialog and making a decision, what message to show
                among several collapsed duplicates...
            </change>
            <change>In order to ease navigation in a Timeline, "Top", "1", "2", "3" and positions
                of three first shown messages are displayed in the top right corner of a message.
                This frees a User from unnecessary attempts to scroll a list.<br/>
                "1" means that this message is the topmost currently shown, but there may be more
                messages in the local cache (i.e. already downloaded to your Device).<br/>
                "Top" shown instead of "1" means that there are no newer messages downloaded, and
                an attempt to "pull to refresh" will result in "sync with Internet".
            </change>
            <change>If not set explicitly in the "Manage Timelines" view, Home Timeline of the
                Default Account is now the Default Timeline - it opens on the Application launch.
                This is natural for new users and simplifies initial configuration.</change>

        <changes>
            <change>
                Individual timelines can now be managed separately in the "Manage Timelines" table
                (in a menu of a list of messages and also in Settings->Timeline).
                For each timeline you can define: if it's shown in a list of available timelines
                and if it's synced automatically.<br/>
                For each timeline sync statistics is shown:<br/>
                * Number of syncs and accumulated numbers of all downloaded and of new messages.<br/>
                * Time of last successful and of last failed syncs.<br/>
                * The last error encountered during syncing.<br/>
                The "Manage Timelines" table scrolls vertically and horizontally and its content
                can be sorted by different columns: just click a column header.

            </change>
            <change>Now you can create custom syncable timelines, e.g. for scheduled
                searches. Thus you can effectively "subscribe" to groups/tags, creating
                automatically synced Search timelines e.g. for "#andstatus" or for "!gnusocial".

                timelines are shown always, which are shown "in a context" only
                (i.e. only when an account of this timeline selected), and which timelines are
                never shown in this list.<br/>
                In any case, any timeline may be opened from the "Manage timelines" list.
            </change>
            <change>Default timeline, which is shown on Application start, is selected in
                the "Manage Timelines" list.</change>
            <change>Additions to Account settings done to simplify management of Account syncing:<br/>
                * "Synced automatically" checkbox.<br/>
                * "Last synced" time.<br/>
                * An option to set Sync frequency of any individual account to a custom value or
                to a common default value set for all accounts
                in Settings->Syncing->Default Sync frequency.

                "all latest messages" (as it always does for a Public timeline in GNU Social by
                the way...).
                In a case you tap "Sync with Internet" again, several minutes later,
                AndStatus will not try to download "all latest messages" again
                - it will request only messages,
                which were sent after the last downloaded message, i.e. just like it does with
                "Don't synchronize old messages..." option turned off.<br/>
                A User sets a value for this option in hours, i.e. "1" or "100" ...
                Empty value or "0" mean that the option is turned off (default behaviour).

                Please note that sometimes two taps on a message text are needed to open a Context

        <changes>
            <change>&quot;Following&quot; timeline renamed to &quot;Friends&quot;. Added
                &quot;Followers&quot; timeline. These timelines are not synced automatically
                to avoid high network traffic: please tap &quot;Sync with Internet&quot;

            <change>Added &quot;Friends of a User&quot; and
                &quot;Followers of a User&quot; User Lists as context menu items
                of the &quot;Users of message&quot; list (and of any User List).
                These lists are synced manually and simultaneously
                with timelines of the same names: by tapping &quot;Sync with Internet&quot;
                action to populate or update the list for a selected User.

                Added &quot;Long press to open Context Menu&quot; setting (defaulting to OFF)
                to the new &quot;Gestures&quot; section of AndStatus settings.
                So, from now on, by default context menus are opened by Tap
                (&quot;Single click&quot;) on an item. Tapping on a User's avatar is the most
                reliable gesture. Tapping a body of a message in a Timeline does the same,
                but in a Conversation view links in a message body become clickable, so tap may
                launch an Internet Browser or open a Context menu, depending on exact place,
                where a User clicked message body.<br/>
                On gestures and their terminology see

            <change>Default value of &quot;ENTER key sends message&quot; setting

            <change>Maximum number of messages, shown in a Timeline at a time, is restricted
                to several hundreds. This change should prevent performance degradation for users
                who receive thousands of new messages daily.<br/>
                Now AndStatus loads not more than 100 messages (a &quot;page&quot;) at a time,
                and it keeps in its memory not more than 5 pages at a time.
                When a User scrolls in any direction and new pages are loaded,
                farther pages are discarded.

                from a local database.<br/>
                Existing &quot;Reload&quot; button (in an Action Bar) renamed to
                &quot;Sync with Internet&quot; in order to clearly distinguish Refresh, which
                doesn't use Internet connection, from Syncing.

            <change>Added &quot;Refresh timeline automatically&quot; option to Settings-&gt;Timeline.
                Turning this setting off may give a noticeable performance increase for users,
                who have many new messages in their timelines and frequent updates.
                This setting allows to have &quot;Syncing while using AndStatus&quot; enabled
                and don't wait too often for a timeline refresh.

                on AndStatus widget, and there are no new messages.

        <changes>
            <change>With this release AndStatus opens a new view for exploration of social
                networks: a &quot;User List&quot;.<br/>
                For years, a &quot;Timeline&quot;, holding list of messages (posts, tweets...),
                was the only representation of Social networks in AndStatus. Most of information about
                members of these networks was hidden. Now we do have a list, where Users
                and information about them is the main content.<br/>
                As with Timelines, there will be different kinds of &quot;User Lists&quot;.
                &quot;Users of message&quot; is the first: it can be opened via a message's
                context menu, and it shows a list, containing not only an Author, a User whom
                the message was addressed to, and rebloggers. It also lists all users mentioned
                in a body of the message.<br/>
                But the main point here is that you can act on these users via new context menu:
                see their profiles in the Internet,
                visit their Homepages, follow and stop following them. More actions will be
                added based on your feedback. Read more and discuss at

                to the new &quot;Filters&quot; settings group.<br/>
                New behavior on message load: If a message is not a Reply to another message,
                AndStatus checks if the message's body starts with @username and marks it as a Reply
                to a User with this username. So such &quot;Replies to a User&quot;
                are also filtered by this option.

            <change>A &quot;star&quot; icon was removed from a timeline for not favorited messages.
                This will avoid confusion of users, who tried to favorite a message
                by clicking on the star. Instead, this should be done via a message context menu
                (tap and hold a message to open its context menu).

                to &quot;Yes&quot; is recommended for these servers.

        <changes>
            <change>Implemented discovery of open GNU Social instances (servers)
                using the new &quot;get_open_instances&quot;
                <a href="http://gstools.org/api/doc/">gstools.org API</a>.
                From now on there is no need to have all open instances
                preconfigured in AndStatus:
                a User may select new &quot;Microblogging system&quot;
                from a live list, downloaded via an online service.
                We hope that this feature will stimulate GNU social instance owners to
                register in this discovery service.

        <changes>
            <change>&quot;Share&quot; message action improved to allow message sharing from one account
                to another, including sharing between different Microblogging systems. When you
                &quot;Share&quot; a message from AndStatus to AndStatus
                (and the same when sharing to AndStatus from any other application...),
                Account selector opens. Shared "Subject" and "Text" are not blindly concatenated,
                as before: you will not have to delete duplicated text.

            <change>Added &quot;ENTER key sends message&quot; option (&quot;on&quot; by default

                Setting it to &quot;off&quot; allows inserting newline
                in the message. In order to see these new lines in the messages,
                &quot;Allow HTML content&quot; option should be set for this Microblogging System.</change>
            <change>Added &quot;Old messages first in Conversation view&quot; option allowing

        <changes>
            <change>Application data backup and restore implemented. This feature may be used in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual backup at any time to SD card (Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Backup application
                        data) and manual restore after reinstall: from the first screen and from
                        Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Restore application data.</li>
                    <li>Automatic backup and restore by Android system. This may work for some devices,
                        but currently is useless for the most users due to Android system internal limitations
                        (see <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/pull/49" >this discussion</a>).</li>
                </ul>
                Preferences, messages and accounts with their credentials are backed up. Avatars are not.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/86" >Issue #86</a>.</change>
            <change>&quot;Sync while using application&quot; option added (turned on by default, as it was earlier).
                When this option is turned off (in Settings-&gt;Syncing),
                there is no background sync while browsing timeline and conversations
                in order to preserve smoothness of scrolling. Manually initiated updates
                occur in background though.</change>
            <change>AndStatus syncing indicator is added to the Timeline screen.
                To turn this feature off,
                go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Syncing indicator on timeline.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/63" >Issue #63</a>.</change>
            <change>Added an option to change Connection timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds.
                (go to Settings-&gt;Syncing-&gt;Connection timeout)
                Increasing this value may improve connections with slow servers.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/83" >Issue #83</a>.</change>
            <change>Overflow button added to Action bars of Activities, which have Options menues.</change>
            <change>BOOT_COMPLETED permission added in order to update a Widget after boot.</change>
            <change>Due to incompatibility with changed Twitter site behavior, addition of new Twitter
                accounts is allowed only for Android v.4.2. and higher. You may workaround this using
                backup/restore. See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/92" >Issue #92</a></change>

        <changes>
            <change>"Public" Timeline added to the list of available timelines.
                The latest messages from the Public Timeline may be fetched on demand
                for StatusNet-type microblogging systems via "Reload" context menu item.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/73" >Issue #73</a>.
                Public timeline is per a Microblogging system, not per an Account.</change>
            <change>Context menu on Public Timeline has a "Global search" item,
                allowing searching messages online for Twitter and StatusNet-type systems
                (requires Internet connection). <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/503" >Pump.io
                    doesn't have a global search service yet</a>.<br/>
                Thus the Public timeline shows both messages, "Reloaded" from Public Timeline directly,
                and messages, retrieved via: "Global Search", "Messages by this User" and Messages,
                automatically retrieved for Conversation trees.</change>
            <change>Options menu in Account activity allows to open Settings
                e.g. to add new Microblogging system.</change>
            <change>Fixed: Android fast scroll thumb disappears after switching Timeline type or "combined" mode.</change>
            <change>In the presence of background operations the Timeline is now operating smoothly
                and doesn't freeze. Potentially long operations moved to the background thread.
                See <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/33" >Issue #33</a></change>
            <change>Spanish translation added, thanks to <a href="https://identi.ca/susobaco" >Suso Comesaña</a></change>
            <change>Fixed "Preserve screen position after content update". As a Timeline is being
                updated in the background, new messages don't cause unexpected list scrolling any more.

            <change>Action bar added to the "Settings" and "Account" screens (for Android 4.x+) in
                order to show a "Way back" to a User. These screens have new, more common names.</change>
            <change>&quot;Manage accounts&quot; link in AndStatus Settings now leads directly to the list of accounts
                avoiding long Android's &quot;System Settings&quot; list.
                This simplifies working with existing accounts.
                In order to add the second and further accounts an additional button created.
                Note: In order to delete an account a User still has to go
                to the native Android interface: System Settings-&gt;Accounts.</change>
            <change>A User Guide updated (English and Russian translations).

                from the "Microblogging System" of one of these types.
                Names of these systems are currently: "Twitter" , "pump.io" , and lots of systems
                of the status.net type with their own Names and Hosts, e.g. "Quitter" at the "quitter.se"
                host, "Friendica" at some of its hosts ("hubs") etc.
                Now User may create any number of "Microblogging systems" of the three existing types.
                In practice, this is mostly useful for the "status.net" sites, including
                <a href="https://quitter.se" >Quitter</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/55" >Friendica</a>.
                See ""Preferences"-"Manage Microblogging Systems" menu item.

            <change>Implemented "More than one StatusNet server"
                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/58" >Issue #58</a></change>
            <change>Added "Allow HTML content" option for each Microblogging system,
                which allows to see formatted message content.
                Pump.io and StatusNet/Friendica support HTML formatting in messages.

            <change>Host of each Microblogging system may be configured. This may allow, for example,
                connection to the Twitter sites through proxy server. On the other hand,

            <change>Fixed "Added accounts are lost when App is moved to SD Card"
                by adding to the AndroidManifest explicit declaration that AndStatus is allowed

                <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/21" >Issue #21</a>.
                In short: Losing application accounts after moving the app to SD card
                is expected Android system behavior.
                In order to address this limitation, AndStatus offers Storage - "Use External Storage"
                option for its data.

            is now customizable (it may be e.g. <a href="https://quitter.se/andstatus" >quitter.se</a>
            or any compatible server). You may have several StatusNet accounts in AndStatus application,
            but all of them should be on the same server. 2. Maximum number of characters

            you are following as an "account1", posts a note, which is more appropriate for discussion
            (replying or reblogging) as your another identity: "account2". This allows your accounts
            to be more focused (on one language, one topic etc.) and to avoid following the same user

        <changes><change><a href="http://pump.io" >Pump.io</a> is a new application by the
            authors of StatusNet and of identi.ca service as it was before July 2013.
            Pump.io is also a new engine for the <a href="http://identi.ca" >identi.ca</a> site,
            which now is a part of the federated, distributed pump.io social network.
            AndStatus sees the whole network as one Microblogging system supporting user accounts
            from all its nodes not limiting to the identi.ca site only.
            After installation of this app version old identi.ca accounts and data
            are automatically converted to be used with the new pump.io system.

        <changes><change>Timeline synchronization is greatly improved because now Android itself does
            this smartly for us.
            A user can <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/1663705?hl=en" >Configure
                account sync options</a> individually for each account
            with Android built-in tools (in Settings-&gt; Personal -&gt; Accounts &amp; Sync).
            E.g. a user may turn Auto-sync on and off for an account.
            <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/29" >Issue #29</a>.
            As a result of this change, &quot;Automatic updates&quot; setting was removed from preferences.
            Please enable Sync in Settings for your old accounts after installing this version of the application!
        </change>
            <change>New preference added: Notification of &quot;Commands in the queue&quot; to be sent. Off by default.

            <change>Creation of new identi.ca accounts disabled, sync for identi.ca accounts doesn't work.
                This is because the identi.ca service changed its underlying API from Twitter-compatible (StatusNet)
                to PumpIo. Hope to add support for the new API in a reasonable time...</change>

        <changes><change>The new "User" timeline added. Normally when you select "User" from the list
            of the timelines,  timeline of the current Account is shown.
            But when you select the "Messages by this User" context menu item, a "User" timeline
            for the selected User is been shown.
            The timeline has messages from the cache which are shown immediately.
            The "Reload" options menu loads the timeline from the Internet. If you have "Automatic updates"
            enabled in preferences, the User's timeline will be updated asynchronously
            even without the manual "Reload" command.

            <change>In the combined timeline, actions on a selected message may be done
                on behalf of the selected account. I.e. not only on behalf of the account
                whose timeline the message belongs to. This allows subscribing to the message
                in one accound and replying to it from another
                (e.g. from the account which is more relevant to the topic of current message).</change>
            <change>"Undo reblog" implemented. Each reblog (retweet) of the same message (tweet) is shown
                as a separate item in the timeline now. This allows to undo reblog from specific account.
                Information about original reblogger is stored also
                (in case we received the message already as a reblog).</change>

            <change>Terminology, independent from twitter.com, is used.
                From now on we will avoid all proprietary terms for non-Twitter accounts.
                At the same time, in order to comply with Twitter "Developer Display Requirements", we will use alternative
                (Twitter's proprietary) terms "tweet" and "retweet" in Twitter accounts and messages ("tweets").

            <change>Combined timeline added.
                In a case of many accounts it's becoming harder to check for new messages in each account.
                A "Combined timeline" allows both read all new messages in one stream
                and search for all messages stored locally in all accounts,
                even if they were downloaded from different systems.
                The "Home Combined" timeline shows not only messages from "Home" timelines of all accounts,
                but also messages, downloaded during other requests: e.g. previous messages of Conversations.
                You can do all usual operations with messages in the Combined Timeline, including favoriting,
                replying and reblogging.

            <change>In case you have accounts from more that one Microblogging system,

                1. Queued tweet sending implemented. Now User doesn't
                have to wait for the "Command execution on a Server"
                and may continue reading and writing tweets.
                Moreover, the same "(close to the) Guaranteed message delivery"
                approach works
                for the other commands also: Timeline reload,
                Favorites creation and deletion.
                AndStatus retries to send commands to the server on every
                automatic update and during any manual command or message
                (Reload or Status update). User is being notified
                about number of messages currently in the queue
                (If Notifications are being enabled).
                2. Changes in the application permissions.
                Two (location) permissions were removed,
                one permission was added to help asynchronous message delivery
                (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).

                1. Fixed bug preventing timeline position restore.
                2. Fixed errors loading data from the Internet due to parallel
                OAuth requests. (e.g. during initial loading of the User's
                timeline).
                3. Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndStatus's
                timelines open faster thanks to less requests and redrawing.
                4. Made first step in switching from parallel
                and, in fact, synchronous requests (Twitter commands) processing to
                the sequential and queued processing, see {@link
                org.andstatus.app.TimelineActivity#queueIntent}

                preference moved to the top of the "User Credentials" preference's
                section, because User can really start from tapping it (typing
                Username is not required for OAuth)!
